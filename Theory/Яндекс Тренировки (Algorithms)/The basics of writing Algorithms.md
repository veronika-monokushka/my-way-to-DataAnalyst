### Drawing tests

**Debugging** if the code doesnt work (на собесах вручную мб - just do/count all the operations on paper)

*If we wrote the code and can't find an error in it:*
1. The method of gaze (debugging manually)
2. Extreme case: *stress testing*  
   - Create alternative code with correct simple solution (complexity can be high) and launch both codes with a generator of random short tests (ex N=10). And look for not matching solutions.  
   - This will be your special case.
